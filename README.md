# Ultrasonic Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Ultrasonic Sensor project demonstrates how to measure distance using an ultrasonic sensor and an Arduino Nano. Ultrasonic sensors utilize sound waves to detect the distance to an object, making them ideal for applications such as obstacle detection, proximity sensing, and robotics. This project allows you to measure distances accurately by sending ultrasonic pulses and calculating the time it takes for the pulses to bounce back from objects.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Ultrasonic Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the trig pin of the ultrasonic sensor to digital pin 9 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the echo pin of the ultrasonic sensor to digital pin 10 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the VCC (power) and GND (ground) pins of the ultrasonic sensor to the corresponding VCC and GND pins on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - Observe the distance readings displayed in the serial monitor as the ultrasonic sensor detects nearby objects.

#### Applications

- **Obstacle Detection:** Use ultrasonic sensors in robotics and autonomous vehicles to detect obstacles and avoid collisions.
- **Proximity Sensing:** Implement ultrasonic sensors in security systems and door automation to detect the presence of individuals.
- **Distance Measurement:** Use ultrasonic sensors for distance measurement in applications such as parking assistance and liquid level sensing.

#### Notes

- Ensure the ultrasonic sensor is mounted securely and positioned correctly for accurate distance measurements.
- Adjust the code parameters, such as the speed of sound (assumed as 343m/s), to calibrate the distance readings based on your specific application requirements.
- Experiment with different ultrasonic sensor models and configurations to optimize performance for your project.
